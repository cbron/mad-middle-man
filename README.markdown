This is the HTML5 boilerplate edition of middleman with compass built in and a 960 grid thrown in for fun. This will stay as a base for new static web projects. Read the middleman page for instructions on how to run the server, build the project, etc...

To install do the following: 

copy this repo
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/cbron/mad-middle-man.git</code></pre>

And install dependancies:
<pre><code>gem install middleman</code></pre>
<pre><code>gem install compass</code></pre>
<pre><code>gem install fancy-buttons</code></pre>

The cd into the directory and run 

<pre><code>middleman</code></pre>

and in the css directory
<pre><code>compass watch</code></pre>

Ahh snap! you are all set up.
